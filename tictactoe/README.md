**100 points** On WhitGit, find the code for a simple "whack-a-mole" website. I used this code as part of a coding camp a couple of summers ago, and wrote the logic for the game in JavaScript. JavaScript is not strongly-typed at all, which gives you a lot of flexibility in code that you're not used to.

Start with my whack-a-mole code. Notice how each part is separated out, and functions are added dynamically. Create a new game that can fit in that framework. **Note:** Don't change my files, but add your own and change the `index.html` to load your files rather than mine. Some example of games I can think of are:
* Simon says
* minesweeper
* Tic-tac-toe
* Where's Waldo

But do feel free to be creative and come up with your own.
